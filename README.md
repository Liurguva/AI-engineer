# AI-engineer
This repository contains Python code for implementing basic machine learning algorithms. The code follows the theories introduced in the book "Artificial Intelligence for Engineers: Basics and Implementations" by Leo Liu. 

The code was created to show how to implement classic AI algorithms in the simplest way. To facilitate learning, we 
1. used the "process-oriented" approach,
2. avoided the use of functions, and
3. tried not to use unnecessary packages.

The goal is to let learners to see how classic machine learning algorithms can be developed from scratch within minutes based on the theory from the AI for Engineers book. Code is available for the following algorithms.
1. Linear Models (basic, logistic regression, multi-class classification)
2. Decision Trees (ID3, CART)
3. SVMs (Basic, Dual Problem)
4. Bayesian Methods
5. ANNs (3-layer Perceptron, MLP)
6. Deep Learning (CNN, LSTM)
7.
